<h1> RecipeApp API </h1>


This backend recipe API app was developed with **Django** and **PostgreSQL**, following Test-Driven Development (**TDD**) principles, and utilizes **Swagger** for clear documentation. **GitHub Actions** automates linting and unit tests, while **Docker/Docker Compose** simplifies deployment. Hosted on **AWS**, the app ensures scalability for efficient recipe management.

**Important:**

Adding the necessary packages to the requirements.txt or requirements.dev.txt(for dev-only packages) file is necessary before any push.
After the push, a series of checks are run automatically(see .github/worflows/checks.yml), including flake8 and the unit tests. Please make sure to format your code before pushing to the repository.
Flake8 which is a great toolkit for checking your code base against coding style (PEP8), and programming errors (like ‚Äúlibrary imported but unused‚Äù and ‚ÄúUndefined name‚Äù).
